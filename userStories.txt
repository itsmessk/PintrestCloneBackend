Can u create a architecture diagram for this in mermaid chart

I'll create a comprehensive architecture diagram for this Pinterest-like application showing the microservices architecture, components, and their interactions.

Pinterest Microservices Architecture
Diagram 
I am going to use rest api no microservices

I'll create a simplified architecture diagram for a REST API-based monolithic application without microservices.

Pinterest Microservices Architecture
Diagram ∙ Version 2 
I've created a simplified architecture diagram for your REST API-based Pinterest application. This shows:

Main Components:

Client Layer: Web and mobile applications
Application Server: Spring Boot monolithic application with layered architecture
Controller Layer (REST endpoints)
Service Layer (business logic)
Repository Layer (data access)
Supporting layers (Security, Validation, Exception Handling, Logging)
Data Layer: Database and caching
External Services: Cloud storage, email, and SMS services
Documentation: Swagger and Postman for API testing
The diagram follows the standard layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns, which aligns well with the implementation guidelines in your document.

I want monolithic and only the things in the document

I'll create a simplified architecture diagram based only on what's mentioned in the document.

Pinterest Microservices Architecture
Diagram ∙ Version 3 
I've created a streamlined architecture diagram showing only the monolithic REST API architecture with components explicitly mentioned in your document:

Key Components:

Frontend: Angular/React with TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
Spring Boot Application with standard layers:
Controller (REST APIs)
Service (with Lambdas & Streams)
DTO (with ModelMapper)
Repository (Spring Data)
Entity (with Lombok)
Cross-Cutting Concerns: Security, Exception Handling, Validation, Logging, and Caching
Database: MySQL/NoSQL
Swagger: For API documentation
This represents a clean monolithic architecture following the layered pattern as described in your implementation guidelines.

Multiple rounds of SonarQube fixes
Detailed documentation requirements
Key Advantages of Monolithic:
✅ Faster Development - No inter-service communication complexity ✅ Simpler Deployment - Single JAR file ✅ Easier Debugging - All code in one place ✅ Simpler Testing - No distributed system testing needed ✅ Less Infrastructure - No service discovery, API gateway complexity

Timeline Comparison:
Architecture	Duration	Complexity
Monolithic	3-4 weeks	Low-Medium
Microservices	6-8 weeks	High
Recommendation:

Solo Developer: Plan for 4 weeks (safer estimate)
2 Developers: Can complete in 3 weeks
Experienced Developer: Possibly 2.5-3 weeks
The monolithic approach is 50% faster and much simpler to implement, test, and maintain for this project scope!

i have only 5 days to compelte this

With only 5 days, you need to be extremely strategic and focus on core functionality only. Here's an aggressive plan:

5-Day Sprint Plan (Monolithic + MongoDB)
Day 1: Foundation & Authentication (8-10 hours)
✅ Spring Boot project setup with MongoDB
✅ Basic security configuration (Spring Security)
✅ User entity and registration (simplified validation)
✅ Login with basic authentication (skip circuit breaker for now)
✅ Exception handling framework
✅ Basic DTO setup with ModelMapper
Day 2: Core Content Features (8-10 hours)
✅ Pin entity and CRUD operations
✅ Board entity and CRUD operations
✅ Image upload (store URLs only, skip actual file upload)
✅ Basic retrieval APIs (get pins, get boards)
✅ Link pins to boards
✅ Basic validation
Day 3: Search & Social Features (8-10 hours)
✅ Search functionality (basic keyword search for pins/boards)
✅ Follow/unfollow functionality
✅ Get followers/following lists
✅ Basic collaboration (shared boards - simplified)
✅ Repository layer completion
Day 4: Business Features & Testing (8-10 hours)
✅ Business profile basics (create, view)
✅ Sponsored pins (simple flag on pins)
✅ Write critical JUnit tests (aim for 40-50% coverage, not 80%)
✅ Swagger documentation (auto-generated)
✅ Postman collection for main APIs
✅ Fix critical bugs
Day 5: Frontend & Final Polish (8-10 hours)
✅ Basic React/Angular pages (registration, login, home, pin view)
✅ Connect frontend to backend APIs
✅ Basic CSS styling (use Bootstrap templates)
✅ Run SonarQube (fix only critical issues)
✅ Create DDL scripts
✅ Take screenshots
✅ Package JAR file
Critical Cuts to Make:
Must Skip/Simplify:
❌ Circuit breaker implementation (too complex)
❌ 80% test coverage (aim for 40-50%)
❌ Password reset with mobile verification
❌ Complex validations (do basic only)
❌ Lazy loading
❌ Caching
❌ Advanced error messages
❌ Draft functionality for pins
❌ Invitation system (too complex)
❌ Advanced business analytics
❌ Perfect SonarQube scores
❌ Extensive frontend polish
Keep It Simple:
Use in-memory file storage or just store image URLs
Basic password validation (not complex regex)
Minimal UI (functional, not beautiful)
Skip some user stories if needed
Focus on working demo over perfection
Priority User Stories (Must Have):
✅ US01: User Registration (simplified)
✅ US02: Login (without circuit breaker)
✅ US03: Content Creation (basic pin creation)
✅ US04: Retrieval of Pins and Boards
✅ US05: Search pins and boards (basic)
⚠️ US06-09: Implement partially/skip if time runs out
✅ US10: Logout
Daily Work Schedule:
8-10 hours/day focused work
Avoid perfectionism - working > perfect
Test as you go (don't leave testing for end)
Use code generators where possible (Spring Initializr, Lombok)
Copy-paste and adapt code patterns
Time-Saving Tips:
Use Spring Boot starter templates
Use Lombok extensively (reduces boilerplate)
Use @RestController with minimal validation
Skip custom validators - use basic @NotNull, @Email
Use embedded MongoDB for testing
Use Bootstrap templates for frontend
Don't write custom CSS - use Bootstrap classes
Use ChatGPT/Claude for boilerplate code generation
Skip LoggingAspect - use simple logging
Minimal Postman testing - just main flows
Realistic Expectation:
With 5 days, you can deliver a working prototype with:

✅ Core features functional
✅ Basic UI that works
⚠️ Minimal testing (~40% coverage)
⚠️ Some user stories incomplete
⚠️ Not all requirements met
Be transparent: If this is a graded project, communicate with your instructor about timeline constraints and focus on demonstrating understanding of concepts rather than 100% completion.

Good luck! Stay focused and prioritize ruthlessly! 🚀

You now have US01-US07 fully implemented:

✅ US01: User Registration
✅ US02: Login
✅ US03: Content Creation
✅ US04: Content Retrieval
✅ US05: Search & Discovery
✅ US06: Followers & Following
✅ US07: Invitations
Would you like me to create US08-09 (Business Features) or US10 (Logout) next? Or shall we focus on testing, documentation, or deployment preparation? 🚀

I think some more thing needs to be added in the doc u made pls check

Let me check the original document again to see what might be missing...

Looking at the document, I notice a few things that might need to be added or clarified:

Potentially Missing Items:
1. From US03 (Content Creation) - Attribution:
✅ We have sourceUrl but could add more detailed attribution fields
The document mentions "attributions to give credit to the original content creator"
2. From US03 - Preview Before Publishing:
⚠️ This is more of a frontend feature - we have draft functionality but not explicit preview
3. From US04 - Search Bar Within Pins/Boards:
⚠️ We have global search, but might need user-specific search within their own pins/boards
4. From US08 & US09 (Business Features):
These are mentioned in the document but we haven't implemented them yet:
Business profiles with showcases
Sponsored pins
Advertising campaigns
Analytics
5. From Non-Functional Requirements:
⚠️ Caching mechanisms (mentioned but not fully implemented)
⚠️ Lazy loading (mentioned but backend support needed)
6. Additional Features in Database Schema but Not in API:
pin_likes table exists but we haven't created Like APIs
pin_saves table exists but we haven't created Save/Repin APIs
Would you like me to:

Add Like & Save/Repin functionality (important social features)
Implement US08 & US09 (Business Profiles & Sponsored Content)
Add user-specific search (search within my pins/boards)
Add caching support (Redis/Spring Cache)
Complete US10 (Logout - though it's simple)
Which would be most helpful for your project? Or would you like me to add all the missing social features (Likes & Saves) since they're core Pinterest functionality?

Project Documentation
Project Name: Pinterest
Project Description:
Pinterest is indeed a social media platform that revolves around the visual discovery and
sharing of content. Users can create accounts to explore and save content, known as "Pins,"
which are typically images or videos that link to external websites. Users can organize their
Pins on virtual boards, categorizing them based on different interests or themes. It uses
microservice architecture in which multiple microservices work together to give a seamless
experience to users. The backend of the application is built using Spring Framework whereas
the frontend is built using Angular/React.
Major Modules:
• User Registration and Login Management
• Content Management
• Search and Discovery
• Connections and Social Interaction
Architecture:
This application uses Microservice Architecture to make it a robust, scalable, and easy-to-
maintain application. Each microservice is responsible for individual tasks and different
microservices communicate with each other using REST APIs. The following microservices
will be implemented:
• User Authentication Service: This microservice will be responsible for user
authentication and managing user profile. It will provide APIs for user registration,
authentication, and updating user profiles.
• Content Microservice: This microservice will manage the creation, storage, and
retrieval of Pins and Boards. It also handles image and video uploads, metadata
storage, and content versioning.
• Collaboration Microservice: This microservice supports collaborative boards
where multiple users can contribute. It also manages access control and
permissions for shared boards.
• Business Account Microservice: This microservice provides features for
businesses, including creating business profiles and running advertising campaigns.
It manages sponsored pins and analytics for business users.
• Gateway Service:
o Acts as the entry point for all requests to the microservices.
o Uses Spring Cloud Gateway to handle routing, load balancing, and traffic
management, authentication/authorization.
o Uses Spring Cloud Consul for service discovery and registration.
Technology Stack:

• Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring REST, Spring Cloud Consul
• Frontend: Angular/React, Typescript/JavaScript HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
• Database: MySQL/NOSQL
• Security - OAuth/Spring Security
Non-Functional Requirements:
• Performance: The application should be fast and responsive, with quick load times
and minimal lag or delay.
• Scalability: The application should be able to handle large amounts of traffic and
scale as needed to accommodate growth.
• Security: The application should be secure and protect user data from unauthorized
access, with measures such as encryption and secure authentication. Secure
password storage using hashing. Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g.,
SQL injection, XSS).
• Reliability: The application should be reliable and available, with minimal downtime
or outages.
• Usability: The application should be easy to use and intuitive, with a clear and
consistent user interface.
• Maintainability: The application should be easy to maintain and update, with clear
and well-organized code that is easy to understand and modify.
• Compatibility: The application should be compatible with a wide range of devices and
browsers, with support for different screen sizes and resolutions.
• Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.
• Session Management: Implement secure session management techniques to
prevent unauthorized access. Consider using short-lived sessions with automatic
timeouts.
• Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading techniques for images and other content,
ensuring faster initial page loads and smoother user experience.
• User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design: Design an intuitive user interface
that is easy to navigate and provides a seamless user experience. Prioritize
responsiveness and clarity across all devices (desktop, mobile, tablets).
Final Deliverables:
• Application archive (.jar ) with source code
• Database DDL Script
• Complete Source code
• Sample screenshots of important screens
Implementation Guidelines:

• Utilize Lombok for model class creation and logging.
• Implement logic using Lambdas and Streams.
• Organize code into logical layers (controller, service, DTO, entity, etc).
• Use meaningful package names reflecting the domain.
• Employ Spring dependency injection for effective component management.
General Guidelines:
Error Handling:
• Handle cases where the user attempts to access without authorization.
• Implement a custom exception to throw user-defined messages.
• Centralized exception handling mechanism should be used to capture exceptions
and translate them into HTTP response.
• Implement proper error handling mechanisms to catch any issues and log all the
service exceptions using LoggingAspect
• Handle success and error responses appropriately with proper messages.
DTOs and Mapping:
• Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) should be used for API request and response.
• Entities should not be exposed directly to APIs.
• Use ModelMapper to convert from entities to dto and vice versa.
Database Interaction:
• Spring Data Repository should be used for database operation.
• Add appropriate properties specific to the application like database properties and
table generation strategies.
API Design:
• All the api should be mapped with the base URI
• Set server port number of your choice.
• Use appropriate HTTP methods and status code for all rest end points.
• Use Swagger for generating the API documentation.

Microservice Communication:
• Circuit Breaker pattern should be implemented for all the critical services with a
timeout of 3 seconds and error threshold of 50%. The circuit breaker should open
after 10 consecutive failures and remain open for 60 seconds. Upon circuit breaker
opening, a fallback mechanism should return a generic message to the client.
• Fallback behaviors should be defined for all critical operations.
• Create two instances for any Microservice and implement load balancing.
Validation:
• Bean validation should be used for all inputs throughout the process.
• Custom Validators should be used for complex validation.
• All request parameters must be validated for null or empty values. For any such
invalid values, ‘Please provide a valid <attribute name>’ should be the error message.
• Any date and time value should not start with zero.
Testing:
• Write JUnit test cases for all service methods using Mockito.
• 80% code coverage should be achieved.
Code Quality: To ensure adherence to coding standards, the project should be analyzed
using SonarQube. The following minimum acceptable values must be met:
SonarQube
Metrics
Minimum
Acceptable Value
Security A
Reliability A
Issues <= 5
Coverage >= 80%
Duplications <=3%
Security
Hotspots 
A

Postman: Once done with implementing the requirements, use Postman or any other
posting tools to test whether the REST endpoints are working fine
